# Firebase Studio - MockInterviewer

This is a NextJS starter project for Firebase Studio that helps you practice for job interviews.

This project is configured for Firebase App Hosting. Deployments are triggered automatically when you push to the `main` branch.

## Local Development

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`. You will need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add your `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`.

## Deployment

1.  Push your code to the `main` branch of your connected GitHub repository.
2.  Ensure you have added the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` as a secret in your Firebase App Hosting backend settings.
3.  App Hosting will automatically build and deploy your application upon every push to the `main` branch.

Ready for version control!
